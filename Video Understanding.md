### Challenges in Video Understanding
- Computationally expensive
  The size of video >>> images
- Lower quality
  Due to motion and image artefacts the visual quality of video is lower than in still images
- Requires a lot of training data
- Timespan limited

### Visual Clues in Video
#### Motion
In comparison to still images, video provides information about visual changes over time. To encode these changes there are two main representations: Optical flow and Trajectories.
