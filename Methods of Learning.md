In computer vision and the field of video analysis in particular, we process very large amounts of data. While a large amount of video is easy to record, labeling is extremely laborous. While most machine learning methods rely on supervised learning, there are other methods wich reduce the requirement for manual data annotation. 


### Supervised Learning
y = f(x, theta) => min_theta |f(x,theta) - y|



### Semi-supervised Learning


### Self-supervised Learning


#### Contrastive Learning
Contrastive learning is a sub-field of self-supervised learning, where the idea is to 


- Different temporal sampling
- Different image crops
- Different data augmentations
- SimCLR 
- Barlow Twins [[Barlow Twins]]
- 



### Unsupervised Learning
